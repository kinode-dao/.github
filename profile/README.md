# Kinode has rebranded to [Hyperware](https://github.com/hyperware-ai)

The domain "www.kinode.org" and our social accounts have been seized by an unauthorized actor. Our project has rebranded to Hyperware and can now be found at [hyperware.ai](https://hyperware.ai).

## What happened?

A scammer has taken control of our previous accounts. To protect our community and continue development, we've rebranded to Hyperware and moved to a new domain.
